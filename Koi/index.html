	<h3>Why would you choose a boring Koi fish as a pet?</h3> 
		<p>
			Koi fish are actually pretty cool once you see how valuable the underwater gems can be.  In the Japanese culture, koi fish can be priced up to half a million dollars!  The great thing about these peaceful underwater giants is that they can live up to 200 years old.

			Personally I've raised many Koi fish in the past and they are such peaceful creatures.  Beautiful and elegant giants are wonderful pets in my honest opinion.
